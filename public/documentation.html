    <h1>Book API documentation</h1>
    <h3>API goal</h3>
    <p>
      Our book API is set to build the server-side component of a books web
      application. The web application will provide users with access to
      information about different books about business, management, personal
      growth, emotional intelligence, and many more. Users will be
      able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of
      their favorite books. It is necessary to login (and therefore, register)
      before doing absolutely anything. To register, go to /register and add
      name, password, email, and a birth date (format yyyy/mm/dd).
    </p>
